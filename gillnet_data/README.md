# Documenting and sharing test-fishing data using the Occurrence core of dwca
## Test fishing from Bear Island as example 

Trying out Darwin core archives for storing and sharing sampling based data (test fishing using electrofishing gear and gillnets from lakes). In this case there are a lot of measurements following indidividuals (e.g. length, weigth, otolith radiuses at different life stages). Therfore using an extensive measurments and facts table as extention to document this.

The folder contains raw data in MS xl format (as punched from field forms), R-code to transfer this to an dwca, and text files (csv) of the formated data ready to upload to the IPT.
