# DwC Archive user cases

A selection of user cases for documenting ecological datasets through Darwin Core Archives and publishe them on GBIF wit focus on sampling basded data sets.

### The current work focuses on documenting datgasets so that they can be used in resararch and management with an quantiative ecological approaches. Studying drivers and treaths (such as climate change) to biodiveristy and ecosystem services inherently requires knowlegde about the dynamics and structure of populations. One important aspect of data required often lacking in the bulk of data out on GBIF is without quantiative information and information about the sampling process, dissabeling applications beyond simple presence only models. 

The new Event Core of Darwin Core Archives offers this possibilites, but have som signifcant drawbacks when it comes to documenting measurments and facts about individuals. The purpose of this repository is to try to provide some user cases, documenting the sampling process in DwC-A. The repository is under developement.
