# DwC Archive user cases

A selection of user cases for documenting ecological datasets through Darwin Core Archives and publishe them on GBIF wit focus on sampling basded data sets.

### What's all the fuss about? 
The current repository focuses on code for documenting sampling based ecological datasets (terrible term, I admit, which ecological datasets are not sampling based?) using [Darwin Core terms](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm) and sharing them through GBIF as Darwin Core Archives so that they can be used in research and management with a quantitative ecological approaches. Studying drivers and treats (such as climate change) to biodiversity and ecosystem services inherently requires knowledge about the dynamics and structure of populations. One important aspect lacking in the bulk of data out on GBIF is without quantitative information and information about the sampling process, disabling applications beyond simple presence only models. 

The new Event Core of Darwin Core Archives offers these possibilities, but have some significant drawbacks when it comes to documenting measurements and facts about individuals. The purpose of this repository is to try to provide some user cases, documenting the sampling process in DwC-A. 

The repository is under Development.
