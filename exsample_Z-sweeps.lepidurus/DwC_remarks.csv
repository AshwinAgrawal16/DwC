"Event","locationID","Here  we use geonames ID to identify the waterbody since no official register number is given for Greenland waterbodies.  In an ideal world we should have a DwC field for waterBodyID and being able to use locationID for identifying sampling stations within a waterbody "
"Event","eventID","Using a UUID to create a global unique identifier and break events down to  the smallest practical unit (in order to facilitate re-use of data e.g. calculating detection probability). In this case only number of individuals per visit to each site was recorded in the field. Ideally we would like to record number of individuals in each sweep  but that information is lost. "
"Event","fieldNumber","A  concordinate field containing the information noted on field forms and on the tubes containing the preserved specimens in the field. Used as an identifier for tracking back to original field notes. "
"Event","eventRemark","the survey looks for tadpole shrimps. Lepidurus arcticus is the only species known in the area  but it would still be good to indicate that we have screened the samples to check if there is any other similar species there. Here we used \"eventTaxonomicRange:Notostraca spp.\" to indicate that. "
"Event","samplingEffort","According to DwC standards samplingEfforth should be a self explanatory field e.g. 16 set sweeps. This is slightly awkward since sampling effort is one of the basics in quantities inference. The term sampleSizeValue and sampleSizeUnit does not cover that properly and is easily misunderstood since this is from a quantitative ecologists perspective inferred as \"The number of units (persons  animals  patients  specified circumstances  etc.) in a population to be studied. The sample size should be big enough to have a high likelihood of detecting a true difference between two groups. \" - i.e. information about the population  not the sampling process.  Using here the format with a separator \"|\" to facilitate reuse of data ( 16 | Z-sweeps) - the sampling effort is crucial in order to  reuse the data (e.g. for calculating detection probability). "
"Event","samplingProtocol","Short self-explanatory description of the sampling effort. Ideally we would like to use a controlled vocabulary / ontology to describe this  but not  aware of the existence of such at the moment. "

"non_DwC_term","UUID","The GUID used for the occurences in this data-set. Since recordings are not at an individual level (nor are the speciments stored as such - bulk samples containing all individuals from a given sampling event) the GUID refferes to a sample of indiviudals constituting the occurence. THe GUID is used together with the resolver (URL) ot create the occurence ID. The field will be filtered away in the IPT when registring the datset as an DwC Archive at GBIF. "
